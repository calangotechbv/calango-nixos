-- epiphany runs Debian 13 and is a target of this flake, as isutton@epiphany.
-- It ran Fedora Linux 44 until then, and this file said it could not be one;
-- docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-bare-debian-bootstrap-design.md still
-- records that as the state of the day it was written.

-- epiphany: the desktop. Two displays, side by side.
--
-- Loaded by hyprland.lua when /etc/hostname matches this file's name. Nothing
-- here is policy -- it is the set of facts about this machine's hardware that
-- the shared config cannot know, because that config is one file replicated to
-- every host by Syncthing.
--
-- The generated hypr/monitors.lua loads *after* this and wins, so anything the
-- Quickshell monitor panel applies still overrides these defaults; they are
-- what the machine falls back to when that file has been deleted or has never
-- been written.

-- Which output carries which half of the workspaces. hyprland.lua owns the rule
-- that 1-5 go to the primary and 6-10 to the secondary; this only says which
-- physical output is which.

-- enumerates as DRM ID 0, so without a rule Hyprland would hand it workspace 1.
