# The night light, as one decision: which gammastep to run, or none at all.
#
# hypr/systemd/night-light.service execs this. It is a wrapper for a reason:
# the unit needs flags chosen from two files quickshell rewrites at runtime,
# and an ExecStart cannot read a file. The alternative -- $ARGS out of an
# EnvironmentFile -- leans on systemd's word-splitting rules, which are a
# footnote most readers do not know, and would put the only branching this
# feature has somewhere tests/night-light.sh cannot reach.
#
# Exits 0 without running anything when there is nothing to do: mode=off, or
# mode=auto before the first location fix. That is what lets the unit be
# ENABLED -- it starts at login, decides for itself, and needs nothing from
# quickshell to be correct. The unit carries no Restart= at all (see its own
# comment for why), so this exit code only matters for `systemctl --user
# status` reading `inactive (dead)` rather than `failed`.
#
# Both paths come from the environment and gammastep is reached through PATH,
# so tests/night-light.sh can fake all of it.
